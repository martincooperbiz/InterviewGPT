+What is a CPU?
user: What is a CPU?
AI: Great question! The CPU (Central Processing Unit), also sometimes called the processor, is the part of a computer system that performs instructions of a computer program. It is considered the "brain" of the computer and is responsible for executing instructions that allow software applications to run. The CPU receives input from input devices, retrieves data from memory, and communicates the results of processing back to output devices.
