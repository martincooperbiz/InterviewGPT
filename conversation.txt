Question 3 (Critical Thinking): Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns the count of all unique strings in the array. For example, if the array given is ["cat", "dog", "cat", "tiger", "dog"], the function would return 3 (since there are three unique strings in the array). Please provide your solution in Python.

    # Initialize a new array to store the non-zero elements
    non_zeros = []
    
    # Count the number of zeros encountered
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for num in arr:
        if num != 0:
            non_zeros.append(num)  # Append non-zero elements to the new array
        else:
            zero_count += 1  # Count the zeros
    
    # Append the zeros to the new array
